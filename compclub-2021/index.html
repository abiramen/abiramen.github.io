Writing a CTF with essentially a 2 hour time constraint was one of my main challenges. Another was catering to a variety of experience levels while remaining within the time limit. I also had to avoid OSINT challenges which involved trawling social media, since I couldn&rsquo;t make the assumption that all students had access to social media.</p><h1 id=challenges-and-solutions>Challenges and solutions</h1><p>Here are all the challenges!

The <code>a</code> values can get pretty big, while <code>b</code> is always relatively small (at most, 6). This suggests that the second number could be some way of indexing a character within a word. Maybe the first number could be the index of the word we&rsquo;re using?</p><p>We can also see a couple of 0s occurring in the index, for example, the second pair is <code>(0, 0)</code>. This suggests that both words and characters are zero-indexed, just like lists and arrays in most programming languages start counting from 0.</p><p>This is what is known as a book cipher. You could either try manually calculating each of the letters, writing a script to do it, or using a website <a href=https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/book-cipher target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">like this one</a>
to decode it. You&rsquo;ll need to convert all the index pairs to match the format on that site. Make sure you select the correct options (word number, character number, none), and set the numbering start to 0.

Avid train nerds may also note that Wynyard doesn&rsquo;t have a Platform 2, as platforms there are numbered from 3. T4 trains on Platform 2 of Martin Place station run eastbound towards Bondi Junction. Two stops in this direction takes us to Edgecliff station.</li><li>We now want to check the train schedule for T4 trains departing after 5:08pm on Fridays.
