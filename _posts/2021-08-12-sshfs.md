{: .alert}
If you're a VS Code user who is in first year, or isn't too used to coding locally, you might be better off checking the easier method of using SSHFS with VS Code [here](/cse-setup).

Hello! About a year and a half ago, I wrote a blogpost about setting up Visual Studio Code to connect to CSE machines using the 'Remote - SSH' extension. 

In hindsight, this was a **terrible mistake** with consequences I could not have foreseen. It turns out that the extension spawns a nodejs server on the remote machine for each connection, which requires an *intense* amount of resources [^1]. 

CSE also has a lot of students, meaning you are not going to be having a good day if your hostname is _corelli_ or _mandolin_ üìâüìâ[^2]. I apologise for the terrible atrocities which I have inflicted upon the servers of the School of Computer Science and Engineering üôèü•∫.

[^1]: This gets worse as you add more extensions. We once spotted someone using a Java language extension eating up nearly a gigabyte of RAM on its own.

[^2]: [Others have considered](https://twitter.com/jashankj/status/1384742308591988736){: target="_blank"} reverse engineering the extension to figure out why it was so unnecessarily resource intensive, only to realise doing so could potentially be a crime.

Anyhow, this guide steps through setting up SSHFS to mount and access your CSE filesystem from your local file system! Doing so allows you to access files on CSE machines as if they are on your own computer, and automatically synchronises any changes to files. This method likely uses less than a tenth of the resources required by the VS Code remote extension!

## Who is this guide for?

If you've reached the end of the first year of your CSE degree, you **probably** should have a local coding setup by now, whether that be:
* a native Linux (or *nix) setup, or
* some form of macOS setup, or
* WSL 2 [^3]

[^3]: There are definitely ways to get SSHFS working natively on Windows, but they're a lot messier, and setting up WSL is definitely advisable.

In that case, I highly recommend using SSHFS if you find yourself needing to work with files directly on CSE machines. If you're in first year and feeling adventurous, you can take a try at setting it up too, but you're probably better off following [this guide](/cse-setup). [^6]

[^6]: I personally much prefer this setup over both the VS Code Remote-SSH and SSHFS extensions just because it seamlessly interfaces with WSL, which is my regular coding setup.

## Getting started üéâ

***obligatory disclaimer**: despite being employed by cse at the time of writing, this does **not** reflect the views of my employer. you get it, don't you?* üëåüëå

Now that that's out of the way, we'll need to install SSHFS to get started.

### Linux and WSL 2

I'm going to assume that you're using an Ubuntu or Debian-based installation (this is most WSL distributions by default), in which case this should be nice and simple. If you're not, you're probably familiar enough with your distro's package manager, or can grab the installer from GitHub [here](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs){:target="_blank"}.

Otherwise, all you'll need to do is **open a terminal** and run `sudo apt install -y openssh-client sshfs` on your own computer.

### macOS
1. **Install Homebrew** if you don't have it already by following the instructions [here](https://brew.sh){: target="_blank"}.
1. **Run** `brew install sshfs` in your terminal and follow any steps which pop up.

## Mounting your CSE home directory

Our goal is to be able to access our CSE files from our own computer. To do this, we'll need to use SSHFS to **mount** them.

1. **If this is your first time, make a directory** in your local home directory by running `mkdir ~/cse` from a terminal. If you want to use a different folder name, feel free to do so, but make sure to use it instead in any future commands. It's important that this is an empty folder.
1. **Run the following command:** `sshfs -o idmap=user -C z5555555@loginX.cse.unsw.edu.au: ~/cse`, replacing with your own zID, and replacing the X with the last digit of your zID. For example, if your zID was z5123456, you'd use `login6.cse.unsw.edu.au`.

Yay! Your CSE files should now be accessible in the `~/cse` directory! You can now access them with the text editor of your choice! For example, if you're a VS Code user, you can run `code ~/cse` to open a new workspace [^4].

[^4]: Make sure to have the 'Remote - WSL' extension installed in VS Code. There's also a weird WSL bug where the `code` command may not work if you're in the `~/cse` directory, so you may need to run it from outside.

**Once you're done working**, you should unmount the CSE filesystem. To do this, run `fusermount -u ~/cse` [^5].

[^5]: It's not the worst thing in the world if you forget/are unable to unmount, but you'll be using up some resources both on your own computer as well as CSE computers.

In order to get a shell on CSE machines and run commands such as `autotest` and `give`, you'll need to run `ssh z5555555@loginX.cse.unsw.edu.au`, (again, with your own zID, and replacing X with the last digit of your zID) and type in 'yes' if any prompts appear. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to exit when you're done.

## Setting up SSH keys

If you're being prompted for your password whenever using SSHFS or SSH, setting up a pair of SSH keys (if you haven't already) is probably a good idea. You can do this by following **Part 4 and 5** of the 'SSH and SSH keys' section [here](https://www.abiram.me/cse-setup#bonus-coins-avoiding-the-need-to-type-your-password-each-time).

## Aliases
Typing in all these commands gets a bit cumbersome. We can use aliases to simplify this process a bit for us!

### Determining your shell
Before we can figure out where to keep our aliases, we'll need to figure out what shell we're doing. In order to do this, run `echo $SHELL`.

It's likely that your shell is either bash or zsh (if not, you're probably cluey enough to figure the rest out yourself). If you're on bash, open or create the file `~/.bashrc`. If you're on zsh, open or create `~/.zshrc` in the text editor of your choice (eg. `code ~/.zshrc`).

### Adding our aliases
Create a newline at the end of the file you just opened, and paste in the following, being sure to replace with your own zID (also make sure to **not** add a space after the equals sign):

```bash
# Your zID (change this)
_SSHFS_ZID=z5555555
# Your desired mountpoint for your CSE home directory
_SSHFS_CSE_MOUNT="$HOME/cse"

alias csemnt="sshfs -o idmap=user -C ${_SSHFS_ZID}@login${_SSHFS_ZID: -1}.cse.unsw.edu.au: ${_SSHFS_CSE_MOUNT}"
alias cseumount="fusermount -lu ${_SSHFS_CSE_MOUNT}"

function cse() {
    # determine where we are relative to the mountpoint (thanks @ralismark)
    local rel=${PWD##${_SSHFS_CSE_MOUNT}}

    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        # if we dont have arguments, we give the user a shell on the remote cse machine.
        if [ "$PWD" = "$rel" ]; then
            # in the case that we're not in our mountpoint, provide a shell in their home directory.
            ssh "${_SSHFS_ZID}@login${_SSHFS_ZID: -1}.cse.unsw.edu.au"
        else
            # if within the mountpoint, cd to the equivalent dir on the remote before providing a shell (thanks @ralismark)
            ssh "${_SSHFS_ZID}@login${_SSHFS_ZID: -1}.cse.unsw.edu.au" -t "cd $(printf "%q" "./$rel"); exec \$SHELL -l"
        fi
    else
        # if we have arguments, we have a command to execute.
        if [ "$PWD" = "$rel" ]; then
            # in the case that we're not in our mountpoint, we'll execute in the home directory.
            ssh -qt "${_SSHFS_ZID}@login${_SSHFS_ZID: -1}.cse.unsw.edu.au" "$@"
        else
            # if within the mountpoint, cd to the equivalent dir on the remote before executing (thanks @ralismark)
            ssh "${_SSHFS_ZID}@login${_SSHFS_ZID: -1}.cse.unsw.edu.au" -qt "cd $(printf "%q" "./$rel") && $(printf "%q " "$@")"
        fi
    fi
}
```

You should now be able to open a new terminal (or run `exec bash` or `exec zsh` depending on which shell you use) and be able to enter `csemnt` to mount your CSE filesystem, and `cseumount` to unmount. You can also use `cse` to get a shell on CSE machines, and even directly run a single command by using `cse 1521 spim -f factorial.s` for example. It's worth noting that Git operations are particularly slow through SSH FS, so it's better to get a shell using `cse` and perform all your Git operations there.

If this doesn't work, and you're on bash, make sure to check the relevant part of the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting
#### mountpoint not empty
This suggests that you're trying to mount to the `~/cse` directory, despite it currently containing files in it, or perhaps being already mounted. If it's the former, remove these files or move them somewhere else if you need them.
#### Code.exe: Invalid argument
There's a weird WSL bug where the `code` command may not work if you're in the `~/cse` directory, so you may need to run it from outside - that is, try `cd ~ && code ~/cse/path/to/file-or-directory`.
#### Aliases in `.bashrc` don't work
There's a chance that your terminal isn't set up to automatically source `.bashrc`. To fix this, open `~/.profile`, add a newline to the end of the file and paste the following in:
```bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
    source "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi
```

## Acknowledgements
While I've vaguely known SSHFS has existed for a bit, I never thought to use it until Nicholas Berridge-Argent published a guide to using SSHFS with CSE [here](https://nickba.dev/misc/cse-sshfs.html). I've been using SSHFS ever since, although the only times I really use CSE machines is if I need to demo something on SPIM. This guide merely expands on Nick's guide, and a massive shoutout goes to him here!

Thanks to [@ralismark](https://github.com/ralismark) for their useful feedback (such as pointing out lazy unmounting exists), and for their scripts to easily run commands and get a shell on the remote machine.
