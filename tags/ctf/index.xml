&lt;p&gt;Setting up infrastructure was much easier this year - being CSESoc&amp;rsquo;s Technical Director meant I had access to a server to host a CTF. The only other challenge that required hosting was lightweight enough for me to run on my spare VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge shoutout to Felix and Paula again for their help with writing up challenges this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="challenges-and-solutions"&gt;Challenges and solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all the challenges! The solutions are hidden until you click on them, so that you can try challenges without spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompClub CTF 2021</title><link>https://abiram.me/compclub-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abiram.me/compclub-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for the opportunity to do some form of high school outreach program for a while, so when CSESoc&amp;rsquo;s (my uni&amp;rsquo;s constituent society for computer science related degrees) CompClub decided to take applications for workshop developers, and saw the option for a security workshop, I knew I had to sign up. The following CTF was the result of my work with the help of a few fellow fantastic volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
