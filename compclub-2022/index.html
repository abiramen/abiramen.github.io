The <code>a</code> values can get pretty big, while <code>b</code> is always relatively small (at most, 6). This suggests that the second number could be some way of indexing a character within a word. Maybe the first number could be the index of the word we&rsquo;re using?</p><p>We can also see a couple of 0s occurring in the index, for example, the a pair is <code>(0, 0)</code>. This suggests that both words and characters are zero-indexed, just like lists and arrays in most programming languages start counting from 0.</p><p>This is what is known as a book cipher. You could either try manually calculating each of the letters, writing a script to do it, or using a website <a href=https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/book-cipher target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">like this one</a>
to decode it. You&rsquo;ll need to convert all the index pairs to match the format on that site.

If you&rsquo;re a boomer like myself (seeing students trying to solve this challenge has made me feel old), you might instantly recognise this as the Yellow Pages logo - if not, you might have had to do some googling.</p><p>From this point, you could check Google Images for &lsquo;yellow pages building&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;d be presented with images of a building in Toronto, Canada which looks to be the same building! This is listed as the (now permanently closed) Yellow Pages Group Tower in Scarborough.</p><p>Looking for the &lsquo;Yellow Pages Group Tower&rsquo; in Google Maps takes us to the intersection of Milner and Progress Ave. Dropping into Street View, we can correlate this with other buildings to confirm that we are indeed on Progress Ave.</p><h6 id=flag>Flag</h6><p><code>COMPCLUB{progress_avenue}</code></p></details><h4 id=fontaine-90-points>fontaine (90 points)</h4><p>Saw this cool fountain a few months ago, can you name it?</p><p>Format: Wrap the name of the fountain with <code>COMPCLUB{}</code>, replacing spaces with underscores.

However, we can still see that the photo was taken on the 9th of April 2021, and there&rsquo;s a comment attached to the file, reading &lsquo;fountain i saw while getting lunch at hacker conf&rsquo;.</p><p>From this, we could take a look at hacker conferences that took places around the 9th of April 2021 with some googling. A result that pops up here is the BSides Canberra 2021 conference.</p><p>We can now google for &lsquo;canberra fountains&rsquo;, giving us the Canberra Times Fountain as the first result.</p><h6 id=flag>Flag</h6><p><code>COMPCLUB{canberra_times_fountain}</code></p></details><h4 id=underpass-145-points>underpass (145 points)</h4><p>What&rsquo;s the name of the park on the other side of the underpass?</p><p>Format: Replace any spaces with underscores and wrap with <code>COMPCLUB{}</code>.

Oh well, this was really fun to watch people attempt to, and struggle to (but thankfully eventually manage to) solve.</p><p>Huge congrats to the two people that did manage to work this out.</p><p>I highly recommend spending at least an hour looking at this image before giving up and reading through the solution below.</p><h6 id=walkthrough>Walkthrough</h6><p>From the signage, we can determine that this is likely in Sydney, with the trees also reinforcing that this is in Australia.</p><p>The key thing to note is the digital sign above the road in the top left of the image. This, as well as the two separate carriageways suggests that this is likely one of Sydney&rsquo;s motorways.</p><p>We can also see see that there appears to be a cycleway running alongside the motorway - this is pretty common in Sydney, with the M2, M4, M5 and M7 all being associated with cycleways.</p><p>The photo appears to be taken at an intersection with another path, from the positioning as well as the signage up ahead.</p><p>Now would be a good time to open up Google Maps and start scanning the aforementioned motorways. From the image, we can get a rough idea of the shapes of the paths and how it interacts with the motorway. We&rsquo;re trying to look for something like this:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/blog/compclub-2022/underpass.jpg alt="cursed path"></p><p>With a bit of time scanning, you should come across this path!</p><h6 id=flag>Flag</h6><p><code>COMPCLUB{lady_penhryn_park}</code></p></details><h3 id=web>Web</h3><h4 id=epf-184-points-across-5-challenges>epf (184 points across 5 challenges)</h4><p>I miss the good old days of Club Penguin&rsquo;s Elite Penguin Force, so I made my own EPF.</p><p>You can try and become an epik penguin!
